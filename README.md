# CECS-277-Final-Project
CECS Final Project: JM JC JT TN

Things done so far (That are actually usable):
Meal Plan
BaseRoom & AquaWorld
BaseFactory and ConcreteFactory

To-Do:
Implement other room classes. Use AquaWorld as a reference.
*Do not use Scanners! Implementing code with scanners will not be utilized in the GUI*
Fully implement FrontDeskAgent/Guest classes
Implement GUI (This should come last)

What I changed:
Made a BaseFactory and a single ConcreteFactory instead of 5 seperate factories
  I changed it because having a single factory seems more concise and it also does this in the BlackWasp example
Updated Meal Plan as per Varela's request
Updated BaseRoom and Aqua World so that they are usable, i.e. they don't require console user input.
