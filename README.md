# CECS-277-Final-Project
CECS Final Project: JM JC JT TN\

To-Do:<br>
Fully implement FrontDeskAgent/Guest classes<br>
Implement GUI (This should come last)<br>

What I changed:<br>
Made a BaseFactory and a single ConcreteFactory instead of 5 seperate factories<br>
  I changed it because having a single factory seems more concise and it also does this in the BlackWasp example<br>
Updated Meal Plan as per Varela's request<br>
Updated BaseRoom and Aqua World so that they are usable, i.e. they don't require console user input.<br>
Updated BaseRoom and Aqua World so that BaseRoom contains all the instance variables and any subclass of BaseRoom only modifies said variables.
